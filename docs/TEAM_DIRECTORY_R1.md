# Dynamic public Team Directory R1

The current directory on `/teams` is owned by Unified Admin at `/admin/team-directory` under the existing `competitions:read` and `competitions:write` permissions. Admin selects one Competition, publishes the directory, edits the Association contact, and edits public metadata on Teams already assigned to that Competition. Team creation and assignment remain in **组织与球队**.

## Data choice

`Team.competitionId` already makes each Team strictly Competition scoped. R1 extends `Team` with nullable public status, contact and note fields plus separate visibility and order fields. The Team primary key represents the unique Competition + Team entry; a second entry table would duplicate this existing relationship. `publicStatus` is free text. No Competition-specific contact is placed on a permanent Organization record.

`TeamDirectorySettings` is a single row with id `current`. It stores the active Competition, publication flag, and independently editable Association contact. The nullable FK uses `ON DELETE SET NULL`. Deleting a Team removes its public metadata with the Team. No historical Team archive schema or data changes.

## Public rule and freshness

The directory can be published while `Competition.publicPublished` is false so recruitment can precede the full Competition detail page. The selected Competition must exist and have `isTestData=false`; the public read also checks this flag. Only Teams under that Competition with `directoryIsPublic=true` render. An unpublished Competition name appears as plain text, without a link to its unavailable detail page. No selected/published Competition and a Competition with zero public Teams have separate empty states, with no historical fallback.

`getPublicTeamDirectory()` selects and returns only approved public identity, status, QQ, email, and note fields. The `/teams` route renders dynamically on each request. Mutations also use the existing `revalidatePath` helper to invalidate `/teams`, including Competition and Team changes. Thus a subsequent request sees a Competition or contact switch without rebuilding or restarting the server.

Writes pass through the authenticated Unified Admin API and service. The service validates non-test Competition selection, Team membership in that Competition, email, order, text length, and visibility. Each settings or Team update and its AuditLog entry share a transaction. A Competition switch also emits a separate audit action. Audit metadata records identifiers and change flags without contact snapshots.

## Verification

`npm run test:team-directory-r1` creates an isolated pre-change database with the accepted main migrations, seeds legacy Competition/Team/Match/Referee rows, applies this migration with Prisma, verifies preserved row counts, zero FK violations, SQLite integrity, clean migration status, and a no-op second deploy. It then tests two Competition switches, contact changes, privacy projection, deletion safety, RBAC, and audit. `npm run test:public-competition-dynamic:http` covers the R3 Competition and historical archive regression. Production build and responsive browser smoke remain required before review.
